> Compare these scores to the bare minimum scores an officer hopeful must surpass in order to be considered competitive: 500yd Swim - 9: 00 Pushups - 100 Sit-ups - 100 Pull-ups - 20 1.5mi Run - 9: 00 An officer applicant who submits these scores would be at the bottom of the stack and would need to distinguish himself further to be seriously considered. A more likely selectee would furnish scores like these: 500yd Swim - 7: 00 Pushups - 120 Sit-ups - 120 Pull-ups - 30 1.5mi Run - 8: 00 Let me be clear: If you can pass the SEAL Challenge, you are fit enough to complete BUD/ S.
