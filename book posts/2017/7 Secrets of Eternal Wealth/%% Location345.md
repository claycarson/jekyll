> My friend Jorge has a great business called American Home Preservation. It’s sort of a feel-good business. You see, Jorge’s business buys failed mortgages from banks. A failed mortgage is when the home owner stops paying it. As you can imagine, there werean awful lot of these in 2008. However, there is no shortage of them now either. Jorge’s company buys these mortgages in bulk at pennies on the dollar from the issuing bank. Then, instead of kicking people out their homes, he negotiates with them and rents the home back to the owner—with an option to buy—at a price they can afford. Because he’s buying the mortgages for pennies on the dollar, the profit margin after renting these homes out is huge. But Jorge doesn’t buy all these mortgages himself; he gets much of it financed through investors. In fact, you can invest as little as a few hundred bucks with Jorge, and he will give you 12% annual return on your investment issued to you as a monthly check. That’s a pretty easy-to-understand model, right? I bet you could easily diagram that out on the back of an envelope.
