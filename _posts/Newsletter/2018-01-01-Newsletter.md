This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.

You can follow me more closely at [my personal website](http://claycarson.net "Personal Website") or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to [my real estate website](http://claycarson.com "Business Website ").

## The Way The World Ends: Not With A Bang But A Paperclip

[Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/the-way-the-world-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-paperclip/ "Wired") takes a look at *[Paperclips](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html "Paperclips")*, a clicker game from  [Frank Lantz](http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/faculty/frank-lantz/ "Frank Lantz") based on speculations in Nick Bostrom’s *[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies](https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742 "Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies")*.

In a [Huffington Post interview](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html "Huffington Post interview"), Bostrom makes his point much more succinctly, albeit less thorough, than a game or his book:

> Suppose we have an AI whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans.

## Born To Be Chased

Plant Earth II has been added to [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80195377 "Planet Earth II"). Just as interesting as the action on screen is the action behind the camera. Early last year, Vox went [behind the scenes](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/2/17/14600648/planet-earth-2-premiere-iguanas-snakes-clip "Snake Island chase") to show how the famous ‘Snake Island’ chase was filmed.

## Book ‘Em

A [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/04/first-ten-.html "Seth Godin") quote from Tim Ferris’ book, [Tools of Titans](https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788 "Tools of Titans"):

> ‘First, Ten,’ and it is a simple theory of marketing that says: tell ten people, show ten people, share it with ten people; ten people who already trust you and already like you. If they don’t tell anybody else, it’s not that good and you should start over. If they do tell other people, you’re on your way.”

I suppose my hope is that 10 of you might share this first issue as a way of showing me you have enjoyed it.
