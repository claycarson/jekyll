THIS IS A TEST

This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.

You can follow me more closely at [my personal website](http://claycarson.net "Personal Website") or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to [my real estate website](http://claycarson.com "Business Website ").

## Simply The Best

[The Best Doesn’t Exist.](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/12/12/18112538/best-search-choices-psychology-barry-schwartz)

> People who are searching for good enough are not second-guessing themselves. When there’s any little imperfection, people who are searching for the best don’t say, “Well, the world has disappointed me.” They say, “I must have made a mistake.”


## Barkley’s Bud

[My Dad's Friendship With Charles Barkley](https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2018/12/14/lin-wang-charles-barkley "My Dad's Friendship With Charles Barkley")

I preferred the audio version to the written article, for what it's worth.

> When Charles Barkley's mother, Charcey Glenn, passed away in June 2015, Barkley's hometown of Leeds, Alabama, came to the funeral to pay respects. But there was also an unexpected guest.
> 
> Barkley’s friends couldn’t quite place him. He wasn’t a basketball player, he wasn’t a sports figure, and he wasn’t from Barkley’s hometown. Here’s what I can tell you about him: He wore striped, red polo shirts tucked into khaki shorts and got really excited about two-for-one deals. He was a commuter. He worked as a cat litter scientist in Muscatine, Iowa. In short, he was everyone’s suburban dad. More specifically, he was my dad.
> 
> "You know, it was obviously a very difficult time," Barkley told me recently. "And the next thing I know, he shows up. Everybody’s like, 'Who’s the Asian dude over there?' I just started laughing. I said, 'That’s my boy, Lin.' They’re, like, 'How do you know him?' I said, 'It’s a long story.' "

## Book ‘Em

[Bill Gates’s ‘5 Books I Loved in 2018’](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2018 "Bill Gates’ ‘5 Books I Loved in 2018")

Three of these are definitely on my list.

1. [Educated: A Memoir](https://www.amazon.com/Educated-Memoir-Tara-Westover-ebook/dp/B072BLVM83/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1546015540&sr=1-1&keywords=educated "Educated: A Memoir")
2. [21 Lessons for the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_31?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=21+lessons+for+the+21st+century+by+yuval+noah+harari&sprefix=21+lessons+for+the+21st+century%2Cstripbooks%2C162&crid=CBXF566BXQHX "21 Lessons for the 21st Century") - Yuval Noah Harari won me over with [Sapiens](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095 "Sapiens") and [Homo Deus](https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0062464310&pd_rd_r=f1c5bce9-0abf-11e9-b54d-a3f4d08ced8f&pd_rd_w=v5lNU&pd_rd_wg=ggnay&pf_rd_p=18bb0b78-4200-49b9-ac91-f141d61a1780&pf_rd_r=N8SRQH1V5QKPXVACSCAM&psc=1&refRID=N8SRQH1V5QKPXVACSCAM "Homo Deus") — the past and the future. Nice of him to make his next stop the present.
3. [The Headspace Guide to Meditation and Mindfulness](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Some-Headspace-Mindfulness-Minutes-ebook/dp/B006ZL1KAW/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1546015593&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Headspace+Guide+to+Meditation+and+Mindfulness "The Headspace Guide to Meditation and Mindfulness") - I’ve tried meditation and the only thing that felt like it made sense was Andy Puddicombe’s app, [Headspace](http://headspace.com "Headspace").
