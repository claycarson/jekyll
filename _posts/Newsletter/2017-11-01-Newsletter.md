# November 2017

## Introduction

This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that in some way made me better or that I found interesting enough to share.

Enjoy!

## What is the plan?

I haven’t completely flushed out what I want this newsletter to be. I want it to be based around some combination of things I stumble upon and the things I have been interested in during the previous month.

## [The Personal MBA by Josh Kaufman](http://personalmba.com "Personal MBA")

I made a huge mistake in letting this book sit on my ‘Next reads’ list for this long. I have taken this book on as more a project and a study than for reading. I am only a fraction of the way into my study but the thing is coated in gold.

> Education is a way to make your mental models more accurate by internalizing the knowledge and experiences other people have collected throughout their lives. The best education helps you learn to see the world in a new, more productive way.

> Every successful business (1) creates or provides something of value that (2) other people want or need (3) at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way that (4) satisfies the purchaser’s needs and expectations and (5) provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.

## [Dan Harmon’s Story Circle](http://patricklickman.com/storycircle/1/ "Dan Harmon’s Story Circle")

> Dan Harmon, creator of Community, Rick and Morty, and co-founder of Channel 101, built a framework to help you tell stories. It's called the story circle, and it's helped countless nerds put their ideas down on paper.

### Part One — Super Basic Shit

> Storytelling comes naturally to humans, but since we live in an unnatural world, we sometimes need a little help doing what we'd naturally do.
> 
> Draw a circle and divide it in half vertically.
> 
> Divide the circle again horizontally.
> 
> Starting from the 12 o clock position and going clockwise, number the 4 points where the lines cross the circle: 1, 3, 5 and 7.
> 
> Number the quarter-sections themselves 2, 4, 6 and 8.
> 
> Here we go, down and dirty:
> 
> 1. A character is in a zone of comfort,
> 2. But they want something.
> 3. They enter an unfamiliar situation,
> 4. Adapt to it,
> 5. Get what they wanted,
> 6. Pay a heavy price for it,
> 7. Then return to their familiar situation,
> 8. Having changed.
> Start thinking of as many of your favorite movies as you can, and see if they apply to this pattern. Now think of your favorite party anecdotes, your most vivid dreams, fairy tales, and listen to a popular song (the music, not necessarily the lyrics). Get used to the idea that stories follow that pattern of descent and return, diving and emerging. Demystify it. See it everywhere. Realize that it's hardwired into your nervous system, and trust that in a vacuum, raised by wolves, your stories would follow this pattern.
> 
> I will talk in greater detail about this pattern in subsequent tutorials.

## Contemplation

A highlight from a book I read this month...

### Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative

> Instead, chew on one thinker—writer, artist, activist, role model—you really love. Study everything there is to know about that thinker. Then find three people that thinker loved, and find out everything about them. Repeat this as many times as you can. Climb up the tree as far as you can go. Once you build your tree, it’s time to start your own branch.
