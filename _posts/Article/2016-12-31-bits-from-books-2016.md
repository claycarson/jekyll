In 2015, I read my first book since high school. Although, I had regularly listened to audiobooks, I had not read a book cover to cover in over a decade. I made it a point that I would use my post-lunch laziness to read.

The year began with me completing my first pass through the Harry Potter series; a stunning fact to most people my age.

## Bits

When I got an Amazon Kindle earlier in the year, I began keeping track of highlights and vocabulary that I was unfamiliar with and archiving my markups upon completion of a book. Below I will share some of my favorites highlights from this year&#8217;s reading.

### Trust Me, I&#8217;m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator

> The human mind “first believes, then evaluates,” as one psychologist put it. To that I’d add, “as long as it doesn’t get distracted first.” 

Holiday, Ryan (2012-07-19). Trust Me, I&#8217;m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator (p. 183). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

### Living with a SEAL: 31 Days Training with the Toughest Man on the Planet

> “Say, SEAL,” I say. “What would you do if there was an intruder in the house?” Slowly SEAL turns and looks at me. He holds me with an even, unemotional stare. Then he turns back to the TV without answering my question.
> 
> “No, really,” I say. “What would you do?” He shakes his head slowly. “I think you know what I’d do,” he says to the TV. “Tell me.” “I would protect the primary.” “What’s the primary?” “That’s the million-dollar question,” he says. “What is your primary, Jesse? What would hurt you the most to lose? This big-screen TV? Those gold record awards you own? Jewelry? Cash? What do you hold most dear?” “No,” I say. “None of that.” “Well?” he asks. “My wife and my son.” “Exactly, Jesse,” he says. “They’re your primary, and as long as I’m in this house they’re my primary too. You asked me what I would do. I would protect my primary at any cost. And unfortunately for you, you’re my third option.” 

Itzler, Jesse (2015-11-03). Living with a SEAL: 31 Days Training with the Toughest Man on the Planet (p. 223). Center Street. Kindle Edition.

> “SEAL, I have a problem,” I say to him. “I didn’t bring any extra underwear.” “So what?” “I can’t run without underwear.” “Nah, bro, you can’t run without legs. It’s on.” 

Itzler, Jesse (2015-11-03). Living with a SEAL: 31 Days Training with the Toughest Man on the Planet (p. 33). Center Street. Kindle Edition.

> “Money is fun to make, fun to spend, and fun to give away. That sums it all up.” 

Itzler, Jesse (2015-11-03). Living with a SEAL: 31 Days Training with the Toughest Man on the Planet (p. 163). Center Street. Kindle Edition.

> “Hey, SEAL, what do you think about when you run?” “Finishing.”
> 
> &#8220;Man, we start, and then, motherfucker, we finish.&#8221; 

Itzler, Jesse (2015-11-03). Living with a SEAL: 31 Days Training with the Toughest Man on the Planet (p. 102). Center Street. Kindle Edition.

### Ego is the Enemy

> The need to be better than, more than, recognized for, far past any reasonable utility— that’s ego. It’s the sense of superiority and certainty that exceeds the bounds of confidence and talent. 

Holiday, Ryan (2016-06-14). Ego Is the Enemy (p. 2). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

> Research shows that while goal visualization is important, after a certain point our mind begins to confuse it with actual progress. The same goes for verbalization. Even talking aloud to ourselves while we work through difficult problems has been shown to significantly decrease insight and breakthroughs. After spending so much time thinking, explaining, and talking about a task, we start to feel that we’ve gotten closer to achieving it. Or worse, when things get tough, we feel we can toss the whole project aside because we’ve given it our best try, although of course we haven’t. 

Holiday, Ryan (2016-06-14). Ego Is the Enemy (p. 27). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

> There is no excuse for not getting your education, and because the information we have before us is so vast, there is no excuse for ever ending that process either. 

Holiday, Ryan (2016-06-14). Ego Is the Enemy (p. 42). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

> Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous. 

Holiday, Ryan (2016-06-14). Ego Is the Enemy (p. 48). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

> The question to ask, when you feel pride, then, is this: What am I missing right now that a more humble person might see? 

Holiday, Ryan (2016-06-14). Ego Is the Enemy (p. 77). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

### So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed

> I once asked a car-crash victim what it had felt like to be in a smashup. She said her eeriest memory was how one second the car was her friend, working for her, its contours designed to fit her body perfectly, everything smooth and sleek and luxurious, and then a blink of an eye later it had become a jagged weapon of torture— like she was inside an iron maiden. Her friend had become her worst enemy. 

Ronson, Jon (2015-03-31). So You&#8217;ve Been Publicly Shamed (p. 70). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

> There were glimpses of a summer day through the windows, and as a corrections officer let us in, she said that tensions were high because warm days are when a person really feels incarcerated. 

Ronson, Jon (2015-03-31). So You&#8217;ve Been Publicly Shamed (p. 255). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

### Shoe Dog

> But my hope was that when I failed, if I failed, I’d fail quickly, so I’d have enough time, enough years, to implement all the hard-won lessons. 

Knight, Phil (2016-04-26). Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike (Kindle Locations 1349-1350). Scribner. Kindle Edition.

> And then Adidas threatened to sue. Adidas already had a new shoe named the “Azteca Gold,” a track spike they were planning to introduce at the same Olympics. No one had ever heard of it, but that didn’t stop Adidas from kicking up a fuss.
    
> Aggravated, I drove up the mountain to Bowerman’s house to talk it all over. We sat on the wide porch, looking down at the river. It sparkled that day like a silver shoelace. He took off his ball cap, put it on again, rubbed his face. “Who was that guy who kicked the shit out of the Aztecs?” he asked. “Cortez,” I said. He grunted. “Okay. Let’s call it the Cortez.” 

Knight, Phil (2016-04-26). Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike (Kindle Locations 1587-1591). Scribner. Kindle Edition.

> He had a superb talent for underplaying the bad, and underplaying the good, for simply being in the moment. 

Knight, Phil (2016-04-26). Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike (Kindle Locations 3310-3311). Scribner. Kindle Edition.

### Turning Pro

> The difference between an amateur and a professional is in their habits. An amateur has amateur habits. A professional has professional habits. 

Pressfield, Steven (2012-05-30). Turning Pro (p. 20). Black Irish Books. Kindle Edition.

> The amateur fears that if he turns pro and lives out his calling, he will have to live up to who he really is and what he is truly capable of. 

Pressfield, Steven (2012-05-30). Turning Pro (p. 53). Black Irish Books. Kindle Edition.

> When we do the work for itself alone, our pursuit of a career (or a living or fame or wealth or notoriety) turns into something else, something loftier and nobler, which we may never even have thought about or aspired to at the beginning. It turns into a practice. 

Pressfield, Steven (2012-05-30). Turning Pro (p. 106). Black Irish Books. Kindle Edition.

### The Obstacle is the Way

> Objective judgment, now at this very moment. Unselfish action, now at this very moment. Willing acceptance— now at this very moment— of all external events. That’s all you need. —Marcus Aurelius 

Holiday, Ryan (2014-05-01). The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph (Kindle Locations 223-226). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

> Remember, a castle can be an intimidating, impenetrable fortress, or it can be turned into a prison when surrounded. 

Holiday, Ryan (2014-05-01). The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph (Kindle Locations 1374-1375). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

> See things for what they are. Do what we can. Endure and bear what we must. What blocked the path now is a path. What once impeded action advances action. The Obstacle is the Way. 

Holiday, Ryan (2014-05-01). The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph (Kindle Locations 2115-2118). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

## Onward

The real shame of my audiobook listening is the lack of ability to highlight. I hope to find a decent way to solve this problem soon.
