Outside of the golf course, it really seems that Tiger felt most comfortable using his superstar status to train with Navy SEALS.

> Eventually, Woods learned how to clear a room, working corners and figuring out lanes of fire, doing something only a handful of civilians are ever allowed to do: run through mock gun battles with actual Navy SEALs. &#8220;He can move through the house,&#8221; says Ed Hiner, a retired SEAL who helped oversee training during the time and wrote a book called First, Fast, Fearless. &#8220;He&#8217;s not freaking out. You escalate it. You start shooting and then you start blowing s&#8212; up. A lot of people freak out. It&#8217;s too loud, it&#8217;s too crazy. He did well.&#8221;
> 
> At one point, Marshall put him through a combat stress shooting course, making him carry a 30-pound ammunition box, do overhead presses with it, do pushups and run up a hill, with shooting mixed in. Tiger struggled with slowing his heart rate down enough to hit the targets, but he attacked the course.
> 
> &#8220;He went all out,&#8221; Marshall said. &#8220;He just f&#8212;ing went all out.&#8221;
> 
> Marshall got his golf clubs at one point and asked Tiger to sign his TaylorMade bag. Tiger refused, sheepishly, saying he couldn&#8217;t sign a competing brand. So Marshall challenged him to a driving contest for the signature. Both Marshall and Brown confirmed what happened next: Tiger grinned and agreed. Some other guys gathered around a raised area overlooking the shooting range. Marshall went first and hit a solid drive, around 260 or 270 yards. Tiger looked at him and teed up a ball, gripping the TaylorMade driver.
> 
> Then he got down on his knees.
> 
> He swung the club like a baseball bat and crushed one out past Marshall&#8217;s drive. Tiger started laughing, and then all the SEALs started laughing, and eventually Marshall was laughing too.
> 
> &#8220;Well, I can just shoot you now and you can die,&#8221; Marshall joked, &#8220;or you can run and die tired.&#8221; 

Today, Woods held a [demo](https://twitter.com/GWJuniorTour/status/723275985894957056) for [Golfweek Junior Tour](https://twitter.com/GWJuniorTour/status/723277404169461760) and is seen hitting golf balls publicly since [late February](https://twitter.com/TigerWoods/status/702492113188032512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).
