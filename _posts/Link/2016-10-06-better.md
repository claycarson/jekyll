> &#8220;And, to be honest, I don&#8217;t have a specific agenda for what I want to do all that differently, apart from what I&#8217;m already trying to do every day: Identify and destroy small-return bullshit; shut off anything that&#8217;s noisier than it is useful; make brutally fast decisions about what I don&#8217;t need to be doing; avoid anything that feels like fake sincerity (especially where it may touch money); demand personal focus on making good things; put a handful of real people near the center of everything. All I know right now is that I want to do all of it better. Everything better.&#8221;
