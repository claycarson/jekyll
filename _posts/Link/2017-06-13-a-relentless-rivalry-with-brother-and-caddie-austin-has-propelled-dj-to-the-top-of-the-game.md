> At the Ryder Cup every little detail becomes an obsession, from the pleats in the golfers&#8217; pants to how the pin positions favor the collective ball flights of the home team. No minutia is insignificant &#8230; unless you&#8217;re Dustin Johnson and his brother-caddie, Austin, golf&#8217;s most laconic characters. During last year&#8217;s event at Hazeltine, Dustin faced a sloping mid-length putt that plainly had two or three feet of right-to-left break. After conferring with his brother, he started his ball a yard left of the hole, missing the putt by at least six feet. Had the tension short-circuited his stroke or perhaps clouded his vision, even though this was just a practice round? In his soft South Carolina drawl, Dustin offered his caddie a different explanation: &#8220;Awwwww, man, I had the [green-reading] book upside down.&#8221;
