> Before he fought in the galactic battles of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was a United States Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company. He tells the story of how and why he became a Marine, the complex transition from soldier to civilian â€” and Arts in the Armed Forces, his nonprofit that brings theater to the military. Because, as he says: &#8220;Self-expression is just as valuable a tool as a rifle on your shoulder.&#8221; Followed by a spirited performance of Marco Ramirez&#8217;s &#8220;I am not Batman&#8221; by Jesse J. Perez and Matt Johnson.
