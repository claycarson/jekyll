<h2 id="branded-in-memory">Branded in Memory</h2>

<p>We asked over 150 Americans to <a href="https://www.signs.com/branded-in-memory/" title="Branded in Memory">draw 10 famous logos from memory as accurately as they could</a>. Based on more than 1,500 drawings created over a period of 80 hours, the results reveal that, far from being stamped perfectly in our collective memory, these ubiquitous emblems largely exist as fuzzy visions in our mind’s eye. One in 5 people thinks the Foot Locker referee wears a hat (he doesn’t), and nearly half of people believe the Starbucks mermaid does not wear a crown (she does). That only scratches the surface of what our study found out.</p>

<p>You can remove yourself from most if not all of the annoying flyers that are sent <em>daily</em>. Red Plum is the main offender. You can unsubscribe <a href="https://www.redplum.com/tools/direct-mail-preferences" title="Red Plum">here</a>.</p>

<p>From one of the best memoirs I have read…</p>

<h3 id="shoe-dogs-a-memoir-by-the-creator-of-nike">Shoe Dogs: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Onitsuka asked what we thought /[new shoe] should be called. Bowerman liked “Aztec,” in homage to the 1968 Olympics, which were being held in Mexico City. I liked that, too. Fine, Onitsuka said.</p>

  <p>The Aztec was born. And then Adidas threatened to sue. Adidas already had a new shoe named the “Azteca Gold,” a track spike they were planning to introduce at the same Olympics. No one had ever heard of it, but that didn’t stop Adidas from kicking up a fuss.</p>

  <p>Aggravated, I drove up the mountain to Bowerman’s house to talk it all over. We sat on the wide porch, looking down at the river. It sparkled that day like a silver shoelace. He took off his ball cap, put it on again, rubbed his face. “Who was that guy who kicked the shit out of the Aztecs?” he asked. “Cortez,” I said. He grunted. “Okay. Let’s call it the Cortez.”
<em>Knight, Phil</em></p>
