<h2 id="where-we-play">Where We Play</h2>

<p>Strava, an app for athletes to track their exercise, has put together <a href="https://blog.strava.com/galleries/heatmap/" title="Strava Heatmap">a heatmap</a> that shows the activity of athletes using their service.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A marathon PR in Berlin, a bikepacking adventure in Mongolia and a ski down the slopes in Utah. Each of these plus over a billion other Strava activities were used to create the new Heatmap. It includes over 27 billion kilometers of data, overlapping to show the most frequented spots for sport on the globe. This incredible visualization was created with 200 thousand years of movement including thousands of marathons and countless coffee rides. What looks like a multihued map of the Earth is actually the white hot visualization of over 1 billion activities on Strava.</p>

<h2 id="the-technology-behind-bitcoin">The Technology Behind Bitcoin</h2>

<p>You have likely heard the buzz around cryptocurrency, and more specifically, Bitcoin. <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/" title="Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> is exciting but the technology behind it could be far more impactful. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8&amp;app=desktop" title="video">video</a> will help you to understand that technology.</p>

<h2 id="paradox-of-success">Paradox of Success</h2>

<p>From <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0804137382/" title="Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less"><em>Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less</em></a> by Greg McKeown…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It leads to what I call “the paradox of success,” which can be summed up in four predictable phases:</p>

  <p>PHASE 1: When we really have clarity of purpose, it enables us to succeed at our endeavor. 
PHASE 2: When we have success, we gain a reputation as a “go to” person. We become “good old [insert name],” who is always there when you need him, and we are presented with increased options and opportunities. 
PHASE 3: When we have increased options and opportunities, which is actually code for demands upon our time and energies, it leads to diffused efforts. We get spread thinner and thinner.
PHASE 4: We become distracted from what would otherwise be our highest level of contribution. The effect of our success has been to undermine the very clarity that led to our success in the first place.</p>
