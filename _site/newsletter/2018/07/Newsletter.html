<blockquote>
  <p>The Telstar 18, the design for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, is as close to a perfect sphere as you can get. It has subtle pimples and six thermally bonded panels designed to avoid knuckling, which is the characteristic bobbing and weaving movement when a ball is kicked without spin. All 32 teams have been able to play with it since November in preparation for the tournament, which runs from June 14 to July 15. But despite its similarities to the old ball, players have grumbled about the Telstar 18. Compared to the last few World Cup balls, the Telstar 18 is very similar to the ball used for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It won’t fly quite as far down the pitch, and will wobble in the air a little differently, but aerodynamic testing suggests it will be more stable in the air overall.</p>

<p>We have just ‘celebrated’ the 20 year anniversary of The Undertaker vs. Mankind in Hell in a Cell. I have known the phrase, “In 1998 The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell.” as a <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-undertaker-threw-mankind-off-hell-in-a-cell" title="meme">meme</a>. What I didn’t know is how absolutely insane the events of this match were.</p>
