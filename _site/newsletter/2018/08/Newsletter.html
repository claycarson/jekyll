<p>Gary Hustwit has a <a href="https://www.hustwit.com/rams/" title="Documentary">documentary</a> about designer Dieter Rams coming out soon.</p>

<p>From objects to influence, Rams’ contribution to our everyday lives is expansive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Dieter Rams’ ability to bring form to a product so that it clearly, concisely and immediately communicates its meaning is remarkable… He remains utterly alone in producing a body of work so consistently beautiful, so right, and so accessible.” – Jonathan Ive, Apple’s Chief Design Officer</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A part of me loves you,
A part of me hates you,
A part of me needs you,
A part of me fears you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this podcast, Jesse David Fox and Bo Burnham discuss the finale to Bo’s special, ‘<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80106124" title="Make Happy">Make Happy</a>’. In an auto-tuned Kanye-esque rant we hear about Pringles, Chipotle, and Bo’s view of the audience and performing.</p>

<p>Bo has directed a movie called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7014006/" title="Eighth Grade">Eighth Grade</a> receiving tremendous acclaim. The production company for the film, <a href="https://a24films.com" title="A24">A24</a>, has had recent success with Ladybird, Moonlight, The Disaster Artist, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, Ex Machina, and The Lobster.</p>

  <p>I’ve read some terrific books lately. When I pulled together this list of five that you might enjoy this summer, I realized that several of my choices wrestle with big questions. What makes a genius tick? Why do bad things happen to good people? Where does humanity come from, and where are we headed?</p>
