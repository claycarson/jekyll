Whereas most competitors are secretive about their competition prep, Marcelo routinely records and uploads his sparring sessions, his exact training for major events. Josh explains the rationale: “Marcelo was visually showing these competitors what he was about to use against them at 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks (away from competition), and his attitude about this was just completely unique: ‘If you’re studying my game, you’re entering my game, and I’ll be better at it than you.’”
