<blockquote>
  <p>I remember one day I was running late for practice, so I was flying down the 405. All of a sudden, I look in the rearview, and I see the flashing lights. This unmarked police truck is right up on me. Tinted windows. Big heavy-duty truck. Woop-woop.</p>

  <p>I knew I was speeding. So I pull over, and I roll the window down, and I’m reaching over into the glove compartment to get my papers ….</p>

  <p>… Then I hear this voice. Big, booming voice.</p>

  <p>“WHERE YOU G’WAN, BOY?”</p>

  <p>I’m like, Damn, they got the sergeant on me or something?</p>

  <p>I turn to look out the window, and I can’t even see this dude’s face he’s so big. All I see is his chest.</p>

  <p>“I SAID WHERE YOU G’WAN BOY?”</p>

  <p>Then he bends down and looks in the window.</p>

  <p>Big, dumbass grin on his face.</p>

  <p>It’s Shaq.</p>

  <p>I’m like, “Yo! I’m going to practice! You made me late!”</p>

  <p>He don’t miss a beat. He taps side of my truck, turns around and says, “Don’t worry about it. I’ll pay your fine. Just holler at me.”</p>

  <p>I’m looking in the rearview mirror, like, How the hell …</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then there’s Stardew Valley—a humble, intimate farming adventure about the monotony of domestic life, in which you spend dozens of hours parenting cabbages. Eric was a team of one. It took him four and a half years to design, program, animate, draw, compose, record, and write everything in the game, working 12-hour days, seven days a week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I first played Stardew Valley all I wanted was to play it on an iPad. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/stardew-valley/id1406710800" title="Stardew Valley for iOS">Stardew Valley for iOS</a> was released in late October. If you do decide to give it a shot, the <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Getting_Started" title="Stardew Valley Wiki">Wiki</a> is required reading as far as I am concerned.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection" title="Mercator Projection - Wikipedia">Mercator projection</a> is a cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It became the standard map projection for nautical navigation because of its ability to represent lines of constant course, known as rhumb lines or loxodromes, as straight segments that conserve the angles with the meridians. Although the linear scale is equal in all directions around any point, thus preserving the angles and the shapes of small objects (making it a conformal map projection), the Mercator projection distorts the size of objects as the latitude increases from the Equator to the poles, where the scale becomes infinite. So, for example, landmasses such as Greenland and Antarctica appear much larger than they actually are, relative to landmasses near the equator such as Central Africa.</p>
