<blockquote>
  <p>I remember one day I was running late for practice, so I was flying down the 405. All of a sudden, I look in the rearview, and I see the flashing lights. This unmarked police truck is right up on me. Tinted windows. Big heavy-duty truck. Woop-woop.</p>

  <p>I knew I was speeding. So I pull over, and I roll the window down, and I’m reaching over into the glove compartment to get my papers ….</p>

  <p>… Then I hear this voice. Big, booming voice.</p>

  <p>“WHERE YOU G’WAN, BOY?”</p>

  <p>I’m like, Damn, they got the sergeant on me or something?</p>

  <p>I turn to look out the window, and I can’t even see this dude’s face he’s so big. All I see is his chest.</p>

  <p>“I SAID WHERE YOU G’WAN BOY?”</p>

  <p>Then he bends down and looks in the window.</p>

  <p>Big, dumbass grin on his face.</p>

  <p>It’s Shaq.</p>

  <p>I’m like, “Yo! I’m going to practice! You made me late!”</p>

  <p>He don’t miss a beat. He taps side of my truck, turns around and says, “Don’t worry about it. I’ll pay your fine. Just holler at me.”</p>

  <p>I’m looking in the rearview mirror, like, How the hell …</p>

It took him four and a half years to design, program, animate, draw, compose, record, and write everything in the game, working 12-hour days, seven days a week.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection" title="Mercator Projection - Wikipedia">Mercator projection</a> is a cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It became the standard map projection for nautical navigation because of its ability to represent lines of constant course, known as rhumb lines or loxodromes, as straight segments that conserve the angles with the meridians. Although the linear scale is equal in all directions around any point, thus preserving the angles and the shapes of small objects (making it a conformal map projection), the Mercator projection distorts the size of objects as the latitude increases from the Equator to the poles, where the scale becomes infinite. So, for example, landmasses such as Greenland and Antarctica appear much larger than they actually are, relative to landmasses near the equator such as Central Africa.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Affiliation with sports teams, it seems, is a contemporary form of tribalism. “Our sports heroes are our warriors,” Cialdini once remarked. And tribal affiliation, along with satisfying our need for a sense of belonging, produces another social pleasure that’s not so warm and fuzzy: the good vibes of walloping your opponent. It’s what Germans call schadenfreude, literally “harm-joy,” the pleasure derived from others’ misfortune.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GoldenEye 007 was originally planned to be a 2D, single-player side-scrolling game, much like Donkey Kong, another game that British developers Rare were producing at the time for the SNES. However, lead developer Martin Hollis suggested it be a 3D first-person shooter for the Nintendo 64, a system and technology that didn’t even fully exist yet. He got his way, and assembled a ragtag team of new-to-gaming developers to begin working on what was expected to be “just another film license” game — games that typically rode the movie’s fame, but didn’t prove to be smash hits, critically or commercially.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Telstar 18, the design for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, is as close to a perfect sphere as you can get. It has subtle pimples and six thermally bonded panels designed to avoid knuckling, which is the characteristic bobbing and weaving movement when a ball is kicked without spin. All 32 teams have been able to play with it since November in preparation for the tournament, which runs from June 14 to July 15. But despite its similarities to the old ball, players have grumbled about the Telstar 18. Compared to the last few World Cup balls, the Telstar 18 is very similar to the ball used for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It won’t fly quite as far down the pitch, and will wobble in the air a little differently, but aerodynamic testing suggests it will be more stable in the air overall.</p>

<p><a href="https://qz.com/email/quartz-obsession/1264216/" title="Zippers">Zip it real good</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t ever expect to see how zippers are made at YKK. Founded in 1934, Yoshida Kōgyō Kabushikigaisha is the world’s zipper kingpin, and it keeps its manufacturing secrets under lock and key. As John Balzar explains in the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/05/news/mn-19744/3" title="LA Times">Los Angeles Times</a>, that’s partly because YKK makes everything—and we mean everything—on its own.</p>

  <p>“YKK smelts its own brass, concocts its own polyester, spins and twists its own thread, weaves and color-dyes cloth for its zipper tapes, forges and molds its scooped zipper teeth, extrudes the monofilament for coil zippers, hammers and paints the sliders, clamps the stops, attaches the dangley pulls in a thousand varieties, and even fabricates the cardboard boxes in which zippers are packaged. Naturally, YKK makes the machines that make the components.”</p>

  <p>Since YKK controls all aspects of its business, it’s widely viewed by design companies as the most dependable and consistent zipper brand on the planet. (Case in point: At <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/branded/2012/04/ykk_zippers_why_so_many_designers_use_them_.html" title="Slate">Slate</a>, Seth Stevenson points out that “When the Japanese earthquake hit in 2011 many supply chains were shredded, but YKK kept rolling along.”) For that reason alone, YKK is a major player in the (very niche) high-end zipper market.</p>

  <p>In a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407518761225" title="How many hours does it take to make a friend?">new report</a> published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, Associate Professor of Communication Studies Jeffrey Hall found that it takes roughly 50 hours of time together to move from mere acquaintance to casual friend, 90 hours to go from that stage to simple “friend” status and more than 200 hours before you can consider someone your close friend.</p>

  <p>This means time spent hanging out, joking around, playing video games and the like. Hours spent working together just don’t count as much, Hall’s study found.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A well-accepted theory of psychology, marketing, and other fields is that human language reflects personality, thinking style, social connections, and emotional states. The frequency with which we use certain categories of words can provide clues to these characteristics. Several researchers found that variations in word usage in writings such as blogs, essays, and tweets can predict aspects of personality.</p>

  <p>IBM conducted a set of studies to understand whether personality characteristics inferred from social media data can predict people’s behavior and preferences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was 1977, and we were leaving a photography session on 23rd Street. Jacques Morali saw the big pink YMCA on 23rd and asked, “What is this YMCA, anyway? “And after laughing at his accent, we told him the Y was a place where you could go when you first came to New York when you didn’t have any money — you can stay there for very little. And of course, someone joked, “Yeah, but don’t bend over in the showers. “And Jacques, bless his heart, said, “I will write a song about this!”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frito-Lay had a formidable research complex near Dallas, where nearly 500 chemists, psychologists and technicians conducted research that cost up to $30 million a year, and the science corps focused intense amounts of resources on questions of crunch, mouth feel and aroma for each of these items. Their tools included a $40,000 device that simulated a chewing mouth to test and perfect the chips, discovering things like the perfect break point: people like a chip that snaps with about four pounds of pressure per square inch.</p>

  <p>To get a better feel for their work, I called on Steven Witherly, a food scientist who wrote a fascinating guide for industry insiders titled, “Why Humans Like Junk Food.” I brought him two shopping bags filled with a variety of chips to taste. He zeroed right in on the Cheetos. “This,” Witherly said, “is one of the most marvelously constructed foods on the planet, in terms of pure pleasure.” He ticked off a dozen attributes of the Cheetos that make the brain say more. But the one he focused on most was the puff’s uncanny ability to melt in the mouth. “It’s called vanishing caloric density,” Witherly said. “If something melts down quickly, your brain thinks that there’s no calories in it… you can just keep eating it forever.”</p>

  <p>We deify willpower and self-control, and mock its absence. People who achieve through remarkable willpower are “strong” and “heroic.” People who need help or structure are “weak.” This is crazy—because few of us can accurately gauge or predict our willpower. We not only overestimate it, we chronically underestimate the power of triggers in our environment to lead us astray. Our environment is a magnificent willpower-reduction machine.</p>

  <p>“When the scammers started to hound Therrien, he hounded them right back. Obsessed with payback, he spent hundreds of hours investigating the dirty side of debt. By day he was still promoting ice cream brands and hiring models for liquor store tastings. But in his spare time, he was living out a revenge fantasy. He befriended loan sharks and blackmailed crooked collectors, getting them to divulge their suppliers, and then their suppliers above them. In method, Therrien was like a prosecutor flipping gangster underlings to get to lieutenants and then the boss. In spirit, he was a bit like Liam Neeson’s vigilante character in the movie Taken—using unflagging aggression to obtain scraps of information and reverse-engineer a criminal syndicate. Therrien didn’t punch anyone in the head, of course. He was simply unstoppable over the phone.”</p>

  <p>In the internet age, recall memory — the ability to spontaneously call information up in your mind — has become less necessary. It’s still good for bar trivia, or remembering your to-do list, but largely, Horvath says, what’s called recognition memory is more important. “So long as you know where that information is at and how to access it, then you don’t really need to recall it,” he says.</p>

  <p>Research has shown that the internet functions as a sort of externalized memory. “When people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information itself,” as one study puts it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.</p>

  <p>By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant. Therefore, we can predict his future only within the large framework of a statistical survey referring to a whole group; the individual personality, however, remains essentially unpredictable. The basis for any predictions would be represented by biological, psychological or sociological conditions. Yet one of the main features of human existence is the capacity to rise above such conditions, to grow beyond them. Man is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary.

<blockquote>
  <p>Waste and recycling work is the fifth most fatal job in America — far more deadly than serving as a police officer or a firefighter. Loggers have the highest fatality rate, followed by fishing workers, aircraft pilots and roofers. From the collection out on garbage trucks, to the processing at transfer stations and recycling centers, to the dumping at landfills, the waste industry averages about one worker fatality a week. Nationally, in 2016, 82 percent of waste-worker deaths occurred in the private sector.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The public is often accused of being disconnected from its military, but frankly, it’s disconnected from just about everything. Farming, mineral extraction, gas and oil production, bulk cargo transport, logging, fishing, infrastructure construction—all the industries that keep the nation going are mostly unacknowledged by the people who depend on them most.

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/when-your-eyes-move-so-do-your-eardrums/551237/" title="When Your Eyes Move, So Do Your Eardrums">When Your Eyes Move, So Do Your Eardrums</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without moving your head, look to your left. Now look to your right. Keep flicking your eyes back and forth, left and right.</p>

  <p>Even if you managed to keep the rest of your body completely still, your eyeballs were not the only parts of your head that just moved. Your ears did, too. Specifically, your eardrums—the thin membranes inside each of your ears—wobbled. As your eyes flitted right, both eardrums bulged to the left, one inward and one outward. They then bounced back and forth a few times, before coming to a halt. When you looked left, they bulged to the right, and oscillated again.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>They also found that the eardrums start to wobble about 10 milliseconds before the eyes. This suggests that the ears aren’t reacting to what’s happening in the eyes. Instead, Groh says, “the brain is saying: I am about to move the eyes; ears, get ready.”</p>

<p>And while we are on the subject of hearing, find out why <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjzepx/sonic-tonic-stressweek2017" title="Sonic Tonic">nature sounds can help you sleep and relax</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As life evolved on Earth, living beings developed different sensory organs to guide them toward food, alert them to danger, and find their way around the world. Without these senses, we couldn’t have survived. But sometimes, these very senses can cause our minds to get over-stimulated. When there’s too much noise, for example, it can be really distressing, but we usually can’t just turn off our hearing.</p>

  <p>From an evolutionary standpoint, this is beneficial to us. If there’s some danger in our environment, we can act accordingly (or wake up, if we happen to be asleep). Sudden sounds jolt us into action, get our hearts pumping, and the adrenaline and cortisol soaring in our bodies so as to prepare us for fight or flight.</p>

  <p>But living in a stream of constant, jarring noises can be highly toxic. One of the biggest problems with urban soundscapes, according to Benfield, is that people think they’ve adjusted to them.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html" title="Huffington Post interview">Huffington Post interview</a>, Bostrom makes his point much more succinctly, albeit less thorough, than a game or his book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose we have an AI whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A marathon PR in Berlin, a bikepacking adventure in Mongolia and a ski down the slopes in Utah. Each of these plus over a billion other Strava activities were used to create the new Heatmap. It includes over 27 billion kilometers of data, overlapping to show the most frequented spots for sport on the globe. This incredible visualization was created with 200 thousand years of movement including thousands of marathons and countless coffee rides. What looks like a multihued map of the Earth is actually the white hot visualization of over 1 billion activities on Strava.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It leads to what I call “the paradox of success,” which can be summed up in four predictable phases:</p>

  <p>PHASE 1: When we really have clarity of purpose, it enables us to succeed at our endeavor. 
PHASE 2: When we have success, we gain a reputation as a “go to” person. We become “good old [insert name],” who is always there when you need him, and we are presented with increased options and opportunities. 
PHASE 3: When we have increased options and opportunities, which is actually code for demands upon our time and energies, it leads to diffused efforts. We get spread thinner and thinner.
PHASE 4: We become distracted from what would otherwise be our highest level of contribution. The effect of our success has been to undermine the very clarity that led to our success in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead, chew on one thinker—writer, artist, activist, role model—you really love. Study everything there is to know about that thinker. Then find three people that thinker loved, and find out everything about them. Repeat this as many times as you can. Climb up the tree as far as you can go. Once you build your tree, it’s time to start your own branch.

<p>This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that in some way made me better or that I found interesting enough to share.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-plan">What is the plan?</h2>

<p>I haven’t completely flushed out what I want this newsletter to be. I want it to be based around some combination of things I stumble upon and the things I have been interested in during the previous month.</p>

<h2 id="the-personal-mba-by-josh-kaufman"><a href="http://personalmba.com" title="Personal MBA">The Personal MBA by Josh Kaufman</a></h2>

<p>I made a huge mistake in letting this book sit on my ‘Next reads’ list for this long. I have taken this book on as more a project and a study than for reading. I am only a fraction of the way into my study but the thing is coated in gold.</p>

  <p>Education is a way to make your mental models more accurate by internalizing the knowledge and experiences other people have collected throughout their lives. The best education helps you learn to see the world in a new, more productive way.</p>

  <p>Every successful business (1) creates or provides something of value that (2) other people want or need (3) at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way that (4) satisfies the purchaser’s needs and expectations and (5) provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dan Harmon, creator of Community, Rick and Morty, and co-founder of Channel 101, built a framework to help you tell stories. It’s called the story circle, and it’s helped countless nerds put their ideas down on paper.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Storytelling comes naturally to humans, but since we live in an unnatural world, we sometimes need a little help doing what we’d naturally do.</p>

  <p>Draw a circle and divide it in half vertically.</p>

  <p>Divide the circle again horizontally.</p>

  <p>Starting from the 12 o clock position and going clockwise, number the 4 points where the lines cross the circle: 1, 3, 5 and 7.</p>

  <p>Number the quarter-sections themselves 2, 4, 6 and 8.</p>

  <p>Here we go, down and dirty:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A character is in a zone of comfort,</li>
    <li>But they want something.</li>
    <li>They enter an unfamiliar situation,</li>
    <li>Adapt to it,</li>
    <li>Get what they wanted,</li>
    <li>Pay a heavy price for it,</li>
    <li>Then return to their familiar situation,</li>
    <li>Having changed.
Start thinking of as many of your favorite movies as you can, and see if they apply to this pattern. Now think of your favorite party anecdotes, your most vivid dreams, fairy tales, and listen to a popular song (the music, not necessarily the lyrics). Get used to the idea that stories follow that pattern of descent and return, diving and emerging. Demystify it. See it everywhere. Realize that it’s hardwired into your nervous system, and trust that in a vacuum, raised by wolves, your stories would follow this pattern.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>I will talk in greater detail about this pattern in subsequent tutorials.</p>

<li><span>Dec 18 2014</span>» <a href="/article/2014/12/hello-world-3.0">Hello World 3.0 <p>I’ve had a blog of some sorts off and on since late 2006. I never really wrote much except for a few ‘tip’ type posts for Mac OS X. A couple of years after that I started tweaking things on my site and figured out how to do <a href="daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> style link posts on <a href="https://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>.</p>

<p>My blog has always been hosted on Wordpress - until now. I am now using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to create a Static Blog that also happens to be free.</p>

<p>This site will host links that I find interesting as well as a few articles about thoughts I feel are worth sharing. You will find some posts and links dated prior to December 18, 2014. These are just a handful of posts from my old site that I felt were still worth sharing and they gave me a bit of an Archive so the site isn’t too bare.</p>

      <p>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory […] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
